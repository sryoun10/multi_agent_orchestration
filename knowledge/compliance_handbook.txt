Introduction: 
The WorkSource System Complaint Handbook provides procedural guidance to local partners for 
processing Workforce Investment Act (WIA) Title–I B, Wagner-Peyser, Trade Adjustment Act (TAA) and 
Discrimination complaints in compliance with federal regulations.  Policy 1012 Revision 1, which introduces 
this handbook, was established to accomplish three primary objectives: 
• To clarify the oversight role of Workforce Development Councils (WDCs).   
• To outline minimum expectations for coordination among partners. 
• To encourage prompt resolution of all customer concerns. 
The handbook builds on this framework by establishing the following: 
• Clarifying roles and responsibilities of partners and programs regarding complaint processing.   
• Providing approved procedures containing minimum federal requirements for processing 
complaints. 
• Providing tools (e.g., complaint log and complaint form) to assist with the implementation of 
procedures that comply with minimum requirements.   
The complaint procedures and tools in this handbook are required by all SWWDC Workforce Investment 
Act service providers and WorkSource partner organizations.  These represent the minimum federal 
requirements and should not be modified to remove minimum federal requirements.

Concerns 
These are written or verbal expressions of dissatisfaction rather than alleged violations of program or 
discrimination regulations noted in this handbook.  Concerns do not require the same formal process as a 
complaint (i.e., logging, tracking, etc.), but do require professionalism on the part of the WorkSource 
System Staff.  Concerns should be resolved at the lowest level possible before escalating to the level of a 
complaint. During this period, the Complaint Coordinator and/or the Local Equal Opportunity Officer is 
available to advise and assist all concerned parties. At any time the complainant has the right to file a 
written formal complaint and will be advised of their rights. 
Who May File a Complaint? 
Complaints may be filed by individuals, organizations, employers, associations or other entities potentially 
affected by an alleged program violation or by individuals alleging discrimination connected to programs or 
services at a WorkSource center or affiliate site.  Concerns may be filed by customers, service providers, 
staff of grant recipients, applicants, labor unions, community-based organizations, local elected officials or 
other interested parties.   
Types of Complaints:  
This handbook describes two types of complaints – programmatic and discrimination – each of which 
follows its own procedures in alignment with federal regulations.   
• Programmatic complaints are complaints which allege a violation of a law, regulations or policy 
connected to Wagner-Peyser, WIA, or TAA programs but do not allege discrimination.  All 
programmatic complaints must be filed within one year of the alleged date of incident.   
• Discrimination complaints are complaints alleging a violation of law(s) that prohibit discrimination in 
federally assisted programs on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, disability, 
political affiliation or belief and (for beneficiaries only) citizenship/status as a lawfully admitted immigrant 
authorized to work in the United States.  Washington State law also prohibits discrimination in public 
accommodation based on marital status, sexual orientation or gender identity, honorably discharged 
veteran or military status, and the use of a trained guide dog or service animal by a person with a 
disability.  Discrimination complaints must be filed within 180 days of the date of the alleged 
discrimination. 
While this handbook introduces separate processes to correspond to the different types of complaints 
described above, all partners are expected to collaborate and be responsive to the needs of all 
WorkSource customers.  Collaboration is essential when a complaint presents allegations that cross 
jurisdictional boundaries, including allegations that involve more than one program or allegations against a 
program that also alleges discrimination.

1. Wagner-Peyser Complaint Procedures 
1.1 
Purpose 
To establish minimum requirements for accepting, fact finding, resolving and referring customer complaints 
and apparent violations connected to Wagner-Peyser funded services or partners.   
1.2 
Wagner-Peyser Specific Definitions 
Apparent Violation – a violation of Wagner-Peyser regulations or employment-related laws by an 
employer, where an employee or ESD representative observes, has reason to believe, or is in receipt of 
information regarding a suspected violation. 
Complainant – an individual, organization, employer, association, or other entity filing a complaint.   
Complaint (Wagner-Peyser) – the submission of a written and signed allegation that Wagner-Peyser (Job 
Service) funded programs/partners violated Wagner-Peyser regulations, and/or an allegation that an 
employer violated federal, state or local employment related laws.  At a minimum, complaints must contain

• Mailing address, or other means by which the complainant may be contacted; 
• Identification of individual(s) or organizations(s) responsible for the alleged issue; 
• A description of the complainant’s allegations, which must include enough details to determine the 
jurisdiction of the complaint and the date(s) the alleged incident(s) took place; and 
• The complainant’s signature and signature date.  The signature of his/her authorized representative is 
also acceptable. 
Complaint Contact – local staff assigned to process complaints according to procedural requirements 
contained in this section.   
Employment Service (ES) Related Complaint – an ES complaint may be an agency related complaint or 
an employer related complaint.   
• An agency related complaint, is where a complainant alleges that ESD or a WorkSource partner, 
through actions or omissions, violated Wagner-Peyser regulations.  
• An employer related complaint, is where a complainant, referred by the WorkSource office on a WA job 
order in the past 12 months, either: 
o Alleges the employer violated the terms and conditions of the job order; or 
o Alleges the employer violated an employment related law such as wages, working conditions, child 
labor laws, sanitation, or housing standards, etc.). 
Non-Employment Service (Non-ES) Related Complaint – a complaint filed by an individual that was not 
referred on a WA job order within the last 12 months that alleges an employer or an agency violated 
federal or state employment related laws. 
Enforcement Agency – a body sanctioned by local, state, or national government to enforce laws.  
Examples may include the Washington State Department of Labor & Industries (L&I), DOL’s Wage & Hour 
Division (WHD), the Washington State Human Rights Commission, etc.   
Page 6 of 37 
H-2A Program – the federal program that allows agricultural employers who anticipate a labor shortage to 
apply for permission to hire foreign workers temporarily.   
H-2B Program – the federal program that allows non-agricultural employers who anticipate a labor 
shortage to apply for permission to hire foreign workers temporarily.   
Migrant Seasonal Farmworker (MSFW) – a migrant farmworker, a seasonal farmworker or a migrant food 
processing worker.   
Resolution – A complaint is considered resolved when: 
• The complainant indicates satisfaction with resolution. 
• The complainant chooses not to elevate a complaint to the next level. 
• The complainant fails to respond to a written request for information within time frames. 
• The complainant exhausts the final level of review. 
• The agency with jurisdiction makes a final determination on a referred complaint. 
Respondent – the individual or entity that is alleged to have committed the violation described in the 
complaint. 
1.3 
Availability of Complaint Contact(s) 
A locally designated complaint contact shall be available to receive ES and Non-ES complaints, in person, 
at all WorkSource centers and affiliates where Wagner-Peyser funded staff are located.   
1.4 
Complaints Received in Person 
If an individual elects to file a complaint, the following minimum steps shall be followed: 
• Offer to assist the complainant in completing a complaint form.  It is recommended, but not required, 
that complainants use the WorkSource Complaint Form or the federally approved Wagner-Peyser 
complaint form known as the ETA 8429.  If the complainant represents several other complainants, all 
complainants must be named.  Only one signature is required from a complainant listed on the form.  
An additional sheet may be attached to the form if more space is needed.  The additional sheet must be 
signed and dated by the complainant. 
• Obtain all necessary information to resolve or refer the complaint. 
• If a complaint is filed by a migrant farm worker, ask the complainant to contact WorkSource before 
leaving the area in order to obtain change of address information.  The complainant shall also be 
advised to communication with the complaint contact during the fact-finding. 
• Provide the complainant and any other complainants named on the form with a copy of the completed 
complaint form. 
• Process as an ES related complaint or Non ES related complaint, depending on jurisdiction (see 
definitions).   
1.5 
Complaints Received in Writing 
• When a complaint in any form (e.g., a letter) is received that is signed by the complainant and includes 
sufficient information to initiate processing, the document must be treated as if it were a properly 
Page 7 of 37 
completed Complaint Form filed in person by the complainant and processed as an employment 
service related or as a non-employment services related complaint.   
• If the complainant has not provided sufficient information, additional information shall be requested

another state, the complaint must be taken in writing and submitted to the state using the information 
noted in section 1.16 for appropriate referral and processing. 
1.9 
Apparent Violations 
• All potential apparent violations must be reported to a local complaint contact. 
• If there is sufficient information to suggest that a violation of Wagner-Peyser regulations or employment 
law occurred, the relevant complaint procedures (i.e., ES or Non-ES) shall be followed. 
• If there is sufficient information to suggest that a violation of Wagner-Peyser regulations or employment 
law occurred, the apparent violation shall also be logged.   
1.10 H-2A & H-2B related Complaints 
• All H-2A and H-2B related complaints, whether received from workers referred through WorkSource or 
otherwise, are considered ES related complaints.   
• If a complainant alleges that the ESD or its personnel, through actions or omissions, violated H-2A and 
H-2B Regulations, the complaint shall be processed as an ES related complaint against the agency. 
• If a complainant files a complaint against an H-2A or H-2B employer, alleging the employer did not 
comply with recruitment requirements or contractual terms, the complaint shall be processed as an ES 
related complaint against the employer.

All MSFW complaints and apparent violations shall be handled according to the type of allegation and 
situation set forth in previous sections except for the following exceptions noted:

additional information, as described in section 1.12. 
1.12 Requests for Additional Information 
If a complaint contact is unable to speak to a complainant for the purposes of obtaining additional 
information needed to resolve a complaint, a written request for additional information shall be sent via 
certified mail or through some other form of communication where receipt can be verified.  All non-MSFW 
complainants are allowed 20 working days from the date of receipt to respond to a written request for 
additional information.  If a complainant does not respond, the complaint shall be considered closed.   
1.13 Confidentiality 
The identity of a complainant(s) or any person who furnishes information related to, or who has assisted in 
an investigation of a complaint shall be kept confidential to the maximum extent possible consistent with 
applicable law and a fair determination of the complaint.  The identity of a complainant may only be 
released upon written consent of the individual(s) furnishing information regarding a complaint or apparent 
violation.   
1.14 Record Keeping 
All records and correspondence related to complaints shall be maintained separately from any other 
records by the complaint contact.  All records regarding ES and non-ES complaints and actions taken must

attached and meets the requirements for all program and EO complaints.  At minimum, the log must 
contain: 
• The name of the complainant;

• If the complaint is ES-related, whether it is employer-related or agency-related; 
• If the complaint (ES-related or non-ES-related)  alleges an employment law violation against an 
employer, the enforcement agency to which the referral was made; and 
• The action taken and whether the complaint has been resolved. 
1.16 Elevating Complaints to the State  
Complaints may be elevated to the state if: 
• No decision or resolution has been reached within 15 working days of the filing of an ES complaint 
against the agency; 
• No decision or resolution has been reached within 15 working days of the filing of an ES complaint 
against an employer that is not employment law related; 
• An ES complaint is made against more than one WorkSource center or affiliate, with an alleged 
agency-wide violation as noted in section 1.8; or 
• A complaint is made against a respondent from another state as noted in section 1.8. 
To elevate a complaint to the state, the complaint contact must submit a written notice to the Director of the 
Workforce & Career Development Division (WCDD) of ESD via e-mail at WCDDPolicy@esd.wa.gov or by 
mail at: 
Workforce Career Development Division 
Employment Security Department

Olympia, WA 98507-9046 
1.17 Discontinuation of Service to Employers  
• ESD shall initiate discontinuation of services procedures, consistent with 20 CFR 658 Subpart F, when 
it has been determined, in response to an ES complaint, that an employer has violated an employment
related law enforced by a federal or state agency and notice of a final determination against the 
employer has been provided to the ESD by that agency. 
• ESD shall notify the local WDC and all local partners providing non-ESD business services whenever 
services are discontinued.

Complaint Contact – local staff assigned to process complaints according to procedural requirements 
contained in this section.   
2.3 
Complaints Received in Person 
If an individual elects to file a complaint, the following minimum steps shall be followed: 
• Offer to assist the complainant in filing a complaint.  It is recommended, but not required, that 
complainants use the WorkSource Complaint Form.   
• Provide the complainant with a completed copy of the complaint form and to any other complainants 
named on the form. 
• Follow procedures for handling TAA complaints.   
2.4 
Complaints Received in Writing 
• When a complaint in any form (e.g., a letter) is received that is signed by the complainant and includes 
sufficient information to initiate processing, the document must be treated as if it were a properly 
completed Complaint Form filed in person by the complainant and processed as a denial of service or 
as a customer service related complaint, depending on jurisdiction, as outlined in this procedure.   
• If the complainant has not provided sufficient information, additional information shall be requested in 
alignment with procedures noted in section 2.9. 
2.5 
Denial of Service 
A TAA service provider may issue a written determination denying a service or benefit available under the 
Trade Adjustment Assistance Program.  These services may include, but are not limited to: 
• Job Search Allowances;  
• Relocation Allowances;  
Page 12 of 37 
• Training (occupational skills, remedial, perquisite, on the job, part-time, distance learning, 
apprenticeship, entrepreneur or customized training);  
• Transportation and subsistence expenses; 
• Trade Adjustment Assistance (TRA); 
• Alternate Trade Adjustment Assistance (ATAA); and/or 
• Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA) 
2.6 
Denial of Service Procedures 
The following procedures must be adhered to when denying a TAA service or benefit: 
• Prior to making the determination to deny services, TAA service providers must make every effort to 
work with the participant by explaining the law or policy, modifying their request, or developing an 
alternative initial training plan. 
• When the TAA service provider exhausts all attempts to resolve the matter with the participant, they 
will issue a formal denial along with the basis for their determination to the participant and the State 
TAA Coordinator.  At this time, the participant will be provided information on their appeal rights.  
Local TAA service providers must have complaints resolved within 15 calendar days or appeals 
forwarded to the State TAA Coordinator. 
• If the State TAA Coordinator disagrees with the decision to deny service or benefits, they may 
request the TAA service provider provide additional documentation and, or information about the 
reason(s) for the denial.  The State TAA Coordinator may overturn the decision of the local TAA 
program administrator when there has been an interpretive error with the law or policy. 
2.7 
Denial of Service Appeal Procedures 
A participant receiving a written determination denying their benefits, who does not agree with the decision, 
has the right to file an appeal.  The participant must file the appeal within 30 calendar days after the date of 
notification or mailing post mark.  There are three primary types of decisions: 
1.  Re-determination of an Entitlement Determination to TAA/TRA  
2.  Determinations of Requests for: 
• Job Search Allowance;  
• Request for Relocation Allowances; or  
• Request for Training Approval and, or transportation & subsistence allowances while in Training; 
3.  UI Determination Notice; or a Determination Notice and Overpayment Assessment on the Trade 
Readjustment Assistance (TRA) portion of a claim, and 
• Determinations for Alternate Trade Adjustment Assistance (ATAA); or 
• Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA). 
The customer (participant) must file the appeal with the TAA service provider.  The service provider will 
contact the State TAA Coordinator or the TRA Coordinator for guidance on processing an appeal packet.  
The local TAA service provider will mail the appeal packet to the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) at the 
following address:

3. WIA Complaint Procedures 
3.1 
Purpose 
To establish minimum requirements for resolving complaints alleging a violation of WIA Title I 
regulations, grants, or other agreements under WIA.   
3.2 
WIA Specific Complaint Definitions 
Complainant – an individual, organization, association, or other entity filing a complaint.   
Complaint (WIA) – the submission of a written and signed allegation that WIA Title 1-B funded 
programs/partners violated WIA Title 1-B regulations.  At a minimum, complaints must contain the following 
information: 
• Complainant’s name; 
• Mailing address, or other means by which the complainant may be contacted; 
• Identification of individual(s) or organizations(s) responsible for the alleged issue; 
• A description of the complainant’s allegations, which must include enough details to determine the 
jurisdiction of the complaint and the date(s) the alleged incident(s) took place; and 
• The complainant’s signature and signature date.  The signature of his/her authorized representative is 
also acceptable. 
Local Hearing – the process by which a local area, through an impartial hearing officer, reaches a 
determination in an attempt to resolve a WIA complaint within 60 calendar days from the date of complaint 
submission.  For all intents and purposes, the local hearing is the formal resolution process prescribed by 
WIA, but complaints can be resolved prior to, and in lieu of, a local hearing.    
Local Hearing Officer – an impartial officer responsible for conducting a hearing.  Impartial officers shall 
not be directly connected to the allegations or potentially affected by the results of the determination(s).   
3.3 
Providing Information about WIA Complaint Procedures  
• Information about the local WIA complaint procedures, including instructions on how to file a complaint, 
must be made available to WIA Title 1-B participants and other interested parties in the WorkSource 
System upon request.   
• Individuals receiving WIA Title 1-B funded services shall be provided a notice of their right to file a 
complaint.  An acknowledgement of receipt shall be signed by the participant and included in the 
participant's file.  For an example, refer to the WIA Summary of Rights and Procedures Form.   
• Reasonable efforts shall be made to ensure that information about the content of the WIA complaint 
procedures will be understood by all individuals, including youth and Limited English Proficient (LEP) 
individuals.  Such efforts must comply with the language requirements of 29 CFR 37.35. 
• All persons filing complaints shall be free from restraint, coercion, reprisal, or discrimination.   
3.4 
Complaint Resolution Timeline 
Complainants must be provided an opportunity to resolve complaints, without a hearing, and an opportunity 
for a hearing if the resolution is not agreeable to any party involved.  An initial resolution should be 
attempted within the first 25 calendar days to allow WDCs sufficient time to prepare for and conduct a 
hearing, in the event that the complaint is not resolved.  The hearing must be completed, and a 
determination provided, within 60 calendar days.   
Page 16 of 37 
3.5 
Local Hearings 
The submission of a complaint is considered a complainant’s hearing request.   A hearing before an 
impartial hearing officer shall be completed within 60 calendar days of the filing of a complaint unless such 
a complaint is resolved prior to the hearing.   
The complainant and the respondent must be notified in writing of the hearing prior to the date of the 
hearing.  The hearing notice shall be in writing and must contain the following information:  
• The date of the notice, name of the complainant, and the name of the party against whom the grievance 
or complaint is filed;  
• The date, time, and place of the hearing;  
• A statement of the alleged violations; and   
• The name, address, and telephone number of the contact person issuing the notice.   
Impartial hearing officers will be provided to conduct hearings on complaints. Hearing officers will be 
individuals who have qualifications necessary to conduct proceedings which meet these requirements and 
to issue decisions which reflect WIA, its regulations, and other applicable laws. No individual will hear or 
decide on issues in cases in which he or she is an interested party. 
Hearings will cover only those matters deemed to be issues pertaining to the particular grounds of the 
complaint, as determined by the hearing officer. 
Full and complete records will be kept of all hearing proceedings. All testimony will be recorded. 
Individuals involved in hearing proceedings have the right to be represented by counsel or other authorized 
agent(s) at their own expense. 
All parties have the right to present witnesses and evidence. 
Complainants have the right to question witnesses and other parties. 
The burden of proof rests with complainants to demonstrate that allegations are true and based on a 
preponderance of evidence. 
A hearing determination will be provided to complainant within 60 calendar days from the date of complaint 
submission. 
3.6 
State Level Appeal 
An appeal may be filed with the state if: 
• No local decision has been reached within 60 calendar days; or 
• If either party remains dissatisfied with the local hearing decision. 
To request a state hearing, the complainant must submit a written and signed notice of appeal to the 
Director of WCDD via e-mail at WCDDPolicy@esd.wa.gov or by mail at: 
Workforce Career Development Division

an investigation of a complaint shall be kept confidential to the maximum extent possible consistent with 
applicable law and a fair determination of the complaint.  The identity of a complainant may only be 
released upon written consent of the individual(s) furnishing information regarding a complaint.   
3.8

4. Discrimination Complaint Procedures  
4.1 
Purpose 
To establish minimum requirements to Workforce Development Councils (WDCs), their subrecipients of the 
WIA Title I grant funds, service providers and centers regarding the development, maintenance, and 
implementation of local-level discrimination complaint procedures.  Under these procedures local area 
One-Stop system customers and staff are able to file discrimination complaints with the entities identified in 
Section 4.3 of this manual.  These procedures apply to the following One-Stop system customers and staff 
in the local area:  
• All customers of One-Stop system programs and services delivered at WorkSource Centers and other 
provider sites in the local area. 
• Partner staff of One-Stop system centers and providers.  Partner staff may file a discrimination 
complaint with his or her organization’s Equal Opportunity Officer or under this policy as provided in 
Section 4.3 of these procedures.  Normally when a partner staff discrimination complaint is against the 
employer or a fellow employee it is filed with the partner’s EO Officer.  When the discrimination 
complaint is against any other center or service provider staff it can be filed with the WDC EO Officer or 
others as provided in Section 4.3 of this manual. 
• ESD staff filing a discrimination complaint against WDC or service provider staff.  ESD staff filing a 
discrimination complaint against other ESD staff would use the provisions of ESD Policy and Procedure 
#0013 – Discrimination Complaint Processing. 
• WDC Board and staff.   
4.2  
Discrimination Complaint Definitions 
Civil Rights Center (CRC) – The CRC is the federal enforcement agency with the United States 
Department of Labor (USDOL) located in Washington D.C., with jurisdiction over discrimination complaints 
alleging violations of WIA, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, Section 504 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, the Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended, and similar laws 
that pertain to recipients of USDOL financial assistance. 
Complaint (Discrimination) – The submission of a written and signed allegation that programs/partners 
violated non-Discrimination regulations.  At a minimum, discrimination complaints must contain the 
following information: 
• Complainant’s name. 
• Mailing address, or other means by which the complainant may be contacted. 
• Identification of individual(s) or organization(s) responsible for the alleged discrimination; and 
• A description of the complainant’s allegations, which must include enough details to determine: 
o WDC jurisdiction over the complaint; 
o if the complaint was filed timely (within 180 calendar days of the incident); 
o specific prohibited bases of the alleged discrimination (i.e., race, sex, etc.); and 
o apparent merit of the complaint. 
• Complainant’s signature or the signature of his/her authorized representative. 
Recipient – as defined in the WIA nondiscrimination regulations 29 CFR Part 37.4 means any entity to 
which financial assistance under WIA Title I is extended, either directly from the U.S.  Department of Labor 
Page 19 of 37 
or through the Governor or another recipient, but excluding the participants or beneficiaries of WIA Title I 
funded programs and activities.   
Recipient includes all One-Stop partners to the extent that they participate in the One-Stop delivery 
system.  As a result, all partners in the One-Stop Delivery system are subject to the nondiscrimination 
requirements of 29 CFR Part 37.  However, only WDCs and above are required to have EO Officers and 
process discrimination complaints. 
Service provider – as defined in the WIA nondiscrimination regulations at 29 CFR Part 37.4 means any 
operator of, or provider of, aid, benefits, services, or training to 1) any WIA Title I funded program or activity 
that receives financial assistance from or through any State or LWIA grant recipient, or to 2) any participant 
through that participant's Individual Training Account (ITA). 
State Equal Opportunity (EO) Officer – The State EO Officer is the individual designated at the state 
level with the oversight responsibility for coordinating, implementing, maintaining and monitoring the 
nondiscrimination and equal opportunity requirements. 
WDC Equal Opportunity (EO) Officer – The WDC EO Officer is the WDC’s designated staff person 
responsible for administration of the WDC and its subrecipients and service providers’ discrimination 
complaint processing as outlined in this policy and procedures.   
4.3 
Filing a Discrimination Complaint  
All grant recipients/program providers under Title I of WIA are responsible for complying with the 
discrimination complaint procedures consistent with 29 CFR Part 37, as outlined in this section: 
• Any person who believes that he or she, or any specific class of individuals, has been or is being 
subjected to discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, 
political affiliation or belief, and for customers only, citizenship or participation in WIA Title I program, 
has the right to file a discrimination complaint. 
• The Washington Law Against Discrimination, RCW 49.60, prohibits discrimination in public 
accommodations on these additional bases: marital status, sexual orientation or gender identity, 
honorably discharged veteran or military status, and the use of a trained guide dog or service animal by 
a person with a disability. 
Discrimination complaints filed on these grounds will be processed based on state law and without any 
references to the U.S.  Department of Labor or the Civil Rights Center.   The complainant is not able to 
file a subsequent complaint with the Civil Rights Center but must file a discrimination complaint with the 
Washington State Human Rights Commission.  It is required, that the discrimination complaint be filed 
on the WorkSource Discrimination Complaint Form.  (English and Spanish attached) 
• A discrimination complaint must be written and it must be filed within one hundred and eighty (180) 
calendar days of the last alleged discriminatory incident.   
• Any customer wishing to file a discrimination complaint must be given the option to file it with the WDC 
EO Officer, State EO Officer or with the Director of the Civil Rights Center, United States Department of 
Labor (CRC/USDOL).  Discrimination complaints may be filed with ESD or the WDC and with the 
CRC/USDOL simultaneously.  Center or provider staff should file a discrimination complaint with their 
Page 20 of 37 
organization’s Equal Opportunity Officer when the allegations are against their employer or a fellow 
employee.  Otherwise they may file as provided in this paragraph.  However, the WDC EO Officer 
should always be notified when a discrimination complaint has been filed and the allegations took place 
at a local center or provider site.  Discrimination complaints received at a WorkSource Center/Affiliate 
or Service Provider should be immediately forwarded to the WDC Equal Opportunity Officer.  Following 
is contact information for the State EO Officer and the USDOL Civil Rights Center: 
State EO Officer 
Employment Security Department 
128 10th Ave.  SW, 5th Floor 
P.O.  Box 9046, 
Olympia, WA 98507-9046 
or 
Director, Civil Rights Center 
U.S.  Department of Labor 
200 Constitution Avenue NW 
Room N-4123 
Washington, DC  20210 
• A discrimination complaint may be filed using the WorkSource Discrimination Complaint Form 
(attached) or the complaint may be written out. 
• No individual, organization or agency may refuse service, discharge or retaliate in any manner against 
any person because that person has filed a discrimination complaint, instituted any proceeding related 
to a discrimination complaint, testified, or is about to testify, in any proceeding or investigation related to 
a discrimination complaint, or has provided information or assisted in an investigation. 
4.4 
Distinguishing Between Program and Discrimination Complaints 
A discrimination complaint is a complaint alleging problems with service delivery or participation as the 
reason for the mistreatment or denial of participation being one or more of the following USDOL prohibited 
factors: race; color; national origin; sex; religion; age; disability; political affiliation or belief; participation in 
WIA Title I financially assisted program; or, citizenship/right to work in the United States.  State prohibited 
factors that also apply are: marital status; sexual orientation or gender identity; or, honorably discharged 
veteran or military status.  The EO Officer and program staff will collaborate to process this discrimination 
complaint. 
However, if the complainant alleges s/he was mistreated in service delivery because of a prohibited factor 
such as race, national origin, sex, etc. and the complainant also alleges she was denied admittance to a 
program because of her income level, these are handled as a separate discrimination complaint and a 
program complaint.  If the complainant had alleged that both were due to prohibited factors, it would be a 
single discrimination complaint.  The discrimination complaint would be processed under these procedures 
and the program complaint would be processed under the appropriate program procedures.  If desired, the 
discrimination complaint Notice of Final Action and the program complaint determination letter may be sent 
in the same letter but must be separate subjects.  The Notice of Final Action should always be signed by 
the Executive Director since the recipient (WDC) and the Governor are jointly and individually liable for all 
violations of the nondiscrimination and equal opportunity provisions of 29 CFR Part 37.  (Part 37.52(a) and 
(b)). 
Discrimination complaint data will be available for review by USDOL Civil Rights Center (CRC) upon 
request. 
Page 21 of 37 
4.5 
Receiving a Discrimination Complaint 
• If the complainant elects to file a discrimination complaint with an employee in a WorkSource center or 
affiliate site, that employee will immediately accept the discrimination complaint and forward it to the 
Complaint Contact who, after reviewing it to determine it is, in fact, a discrimination complaint, will 
forward it to the WDC EO Officer. 
• The WDC EO Officer is responsible for providing local intake services for discrimination complaints to 
determine if the complaint is covered by 29 CFR Part 37, and for resolving jurisdictional issues, if any. 
• Upon receipt of a discrimination complaint, the WDC EO Officer will log the complaint and, if necessary, 
shall confer with the State EO Officer prior to determining jurisdiction over the matter.   
If the WDC EO Officer determines s/he does not have jurisdiction over the discrimination complaint, 
s/he must immediately notify the complainant in writing, including the reasons for the determination.  
This Notice of Lack of Jurisdiction must advise the complainant that he has a right to file a complaint 
with the Director of CRC within thirty (30) calendar days of the issuance of the notice.  If the WDC EO 
Officer determines that another entity has jurisdiction, she will promptly refer the discrimination 
complaint to that entity and also promptly notify the complainant of the referral. 
4.6 
Initial Letter, Contents and Timeframes for Processing a Discrimination Complaint 
Within ten (10) working days of receipt of the discrimination complaint, the WDC EO Officer shall issue an 
initial written Notice of Receipt to the complainant that contains the following information: 
• Acknowledgement of receipt of the discrimination complaint. 
• Advising the complainant of his right to seek representation by an attorney or other individual of his 
choice in the discrimination complaint process. 
• A list of each issue raised in the discrimination complaint and, for each issue, a statement that the issue 
is accepted for investigation or is not accepted.  The reason(s) must be provided for rejection. 
• Advising the complainant of the timeframes for processing the discrimination complaint and providing a 
determination. 
• The total time allowed for processing the discrimination complaint is ninety (90) calendar days from the 
date on which the complaint was filed.  There is no extension available.  This timeframe includes sixty 
(60) days at the local level and thirty (30) days for review at the state level, if needed. 
• If the complainant elects to file with both CRC and the WDC, the complainant shall be informed that the 
WDC has ninety (90) calendar days to process the discrimination complaint and that CRC shall not 
investigate the complaint until the ninety (90) calendar-day period has expired. 
• The complainant must be given an invitation to participate in mediation.  This is sent out with the notice 
of receipt.  For more information, see section 4.7.  
Immediately after issuance of the Notice of Receipt to the complainant, the WDC EO Officer shall either 
begin the fact-finding or investigation of the discrimination complaint, or arrange to have an investigation 
conducted by an individual trained in conducting discrimination complaint investigations. 
4.7 
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)/Mediation Process 
• The WDC EO Officer will include an Invitation to Mediation with the Notice of Receipt, offering 
discrimination complainants the opportunity to use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR).  Complainants 
may voluntarily elect to participate in ADR, which usually takes the form of mediation.  If the 
complainant selects mediation, it allows disputes to be resolved in a less adversarial manner.  With 
mediation, a neutral party assists two opposing parties in a dispute come to an agreement to resolve 
Page 22 of 37 
their issue.  The mediator does not function as a judge or arbiter but simply helps the parties resolve 
the dispute themselves.   
• Upon receiving a request to mediate, the WDC EO Officer will process the request and then 
immediately forward it to the State EO Officer.  The State EO Officer will coordinate with the WDC EO 
Officer to contract with an approved mediator.  The individual conducting the mediation must be a 
neutral and impartial third party who will act as a facilitator.  The mediator must be a person who is 
acceptable to all parties and who will assist the parties in resolving their disputes. 
• If the complainant chooses to participate in mediation, he or his designee must respond in writing within 
ten (10) calendar days of the date of the invitation.  This written acceptance must be dated and signed 
by the complainant and must also include the relief sought. 
• After mediation is arranged, a written confirmation identifying the date, time and location of the 
mediation conference will be sent to both parties. 
• If at all possible, the mediation process should be completed within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt 
of the discrimination complaint.  This will assist in keeping within the ninety (90) calendar-day timeframe 
of the written Notice of Final Action if the mediation is not successful. 
• A consent form will be signed by both parties at initiation of the mediation process affirming that the 
contents of the mediation will be kept confidential. 
• If resolution is reached under ADR/mediation, the agreement will be in writing.  A copy of the signed 
agreement will be sent to the State EO Officer. 
• If an agreement is reached under ADR/mediation but a party to the agreement believes his agreement 
has been breached, the non-breaching party may file a complaint with the CRC Director. 
• If the parties do not reach resolution under ADR/mediation, the WDC EO Officer will continue with the 
investigation. 
4.8 
Notice of Final Action 
A written Notice of Final Action will be provided to the complainant within ninety (90) calendar days of the 
date the discrimination complaint was filed.  It will contain: 
• A statement regarding the disposition of each issue raised in the discrimination complaint and the 
reason for the determination. 
• If the discrimination complaint was resolved by mediation, a copy of the agreement will be attached to 
the Notice of Final Action. 
• A notice that the complainant has the right to file a complaint with CRC within thirty (30) calendar days 
after the date the Notice of Final Action is issued, if the complainant is dissatisfied with the recipient’s 
final action on the discrimination complaint. 
The State EO Officer will review discrimination complaint data on a routine basis.  Should deficiencies be 
noted in the implementation of these discrimination complaint procedures by any WDC, the State EO 
Officer will collaborate with the WDC EO Officer to review the information and/or provide technical 
assistance in the discrimination complaint process, alternative dispute resolution, and/or investigation.  
Discrimination complaint data will be available for review by CRC/USDOL upon request. 
4.9 
Corrective Action 
If discrimination is found through the process of a complaint investigation, the respondent shall be 
requested to voluntarily comply with corrective action(s) or a conciliation agreement to implement remedial 
action.  If voluntary compliance efforts fail, sanctions may be considered.  Prior to sanctions being applied, 
procedural due process will be provided. 
Page 23 of 37 
4.10 Confidentiality 
WDC EO Officers are required to keep the following information confidential to the maximum extent possible, 
consistent with applicable law and fair determination of the discrimination complaint: 
• The fact that the discrimination complaint has been filed; 
• The identity of the complainant(s); 
• The identity of individual respondents to the allegations; and  
• The identity of any person(s) who furnished information relative to, or assisting in, a complaint investigation. 
A log will be maintained at the WDC level for logging, tracking, and reporting on discrimination complaints.  
A Complaint Log is attached and meets the requirements for program and EO complaints. 
4.11 Record Keeping 
WDC EO Officers must maintain a log of discrimination complaints filed that allege discrimination based on 
race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, political affiliation or belief, citizenship, and/or 
participation in a WIA Title I financially assisted program or activity.   
The log must include: 
• The name and address of the complainant;  
• The basis of the discrimination complaint;  
• A description of complaint;  
• The date the complaint was filed;

6. Concern and Complaint Processing Questions & Answers (Q&A) 
 
 Question Answer 
1.  What is the difference 
between a concern 
and a complaint? 
 
A concern is any verbal expression of dissatisfaction.  A written expression of 
dissatisfaction may also be processed as a concern except for alleged violations of 
program or non-discrimination rules or laws noted in this handbook.   
 
Concerns do not require the same formal process as a complaint (i.e., logging, 
tracking, etc.).  Local processes may include additional requirements for processing 
concerns.   
 
2.  What do I do if I’m not 
familiar with the 
program or scope of 
the concern 
presented?   
 
Customers can’t be expected to know what program they are connected to or who to 
ask for help.  Our goal is to resolve all concerns as easily and quickly as possible.  
Because WorkSource customers usually don’t know what program they are 
connected to it’s important to do your best to assist any customer to defuse 
situations as early as possible.  If necessary, connect the customer with the 
appropriate partner or do some networking and get back to the customer.  Complaint 
submission is not required to connect the customer with the appropriate contact.      
 
3.  What should I do if a 
customer indicates 
they want to file a 
complaint? 
 
If you haven’t already, ask the customer what would resolve the issue and offer 
assistance.  Often times the customer just wants to express a concern or receive 
assistance, without realizing the implications of submitting a formal complaint.  That 
being said, a customer has the right to due process.  If the customer’s intent is to file 
a complaint, direct the customer to the appropriate complaint contact for further 
processing. 
 
4.  Can a complaint be 
filed via e-mail? 
 
An e-mail, alone, is not considered a complaint.  A complaint must contain sufficient 
information to initiate fact-finding (see complaint definition) and a physical signature.  
Without a signature, partners may not have legal authority to attempt a resolution of 
a complaint.  However, an e-mail that includes an attached letter or form, if it 
contains a physical signature and sufficient information to initiate fact-finding, can be 
accepted as a complaint.  Under those circumstances, both the e-mail trail and the 
signed copy of the complaint form/letter shall be included in a complaint file.   
 
5.  What is an example of 
a written concern that 
is not a complaint? 
 
Here’s an example: an e-mail submitted to a legislator expressing dissatisfaction 
with services is considered a concern if it does not contain an attachment with a 
physical signature.   
 
Also, a written expression of dissatisfaction made against a WorkSource partner that 
administers a program or a process not covered by this handbook may be processed 
as a concern (and referred as appropriate), even if it contains a physical signature.  
The complaint processes in this handbook are tied to specific funding sources, and 
external complaint processes exist to correspond with external funding sources. 
 
6.  Do concerns resolved 
at the local level need 
to be logged? 
 
A local area is not required to track customer concerns.  However, a local area may 
choose to document concerns through the use of a log or some other method.   
 
7.  How can a customer 
file a complaint? 
 
A customer may file a complaint by submitting a locally approved complaint form that 
is filled out and signed or by submitting a signed letter with sufficient information to 
initiate fact-finding.  This handbook contains additional information regarding what 
must be included on a complaint form, including an optional form that can be 
Page 34 of 37 
 
implemented. 
 
8.  Who has local 
authority over 
program complaint 
jurisdiction? 
 
For WIA related complaints it would be the WDC Director or appointee (WIA 
complaint contact); for Wagner-Peyser and TAA related complaints, it would be the 
WCDD Regional Director or appointee (Wagner-Peyser or TAA Complaint Contact).  
For discrimination complaints, it will depend on the programs involved, and we 
advise you to start by consulting your local EO officer for complaints of this nature. 
 
9.  May WDCs develop a 
local policy and 
process that applies 
to all WorkSource 
sites located in a 
WDA? 
 
Yes, it is not required for each site to maintain separate policies or procedures.  
However, local areas may consider appointing more than one complaint contact (or 
other representative) to assist with facilitation of the WDA’s process even if the WDA 
is governed by one policy/procedure. 
10.  Is a local hearing 
required to respond to 
a Wagner-Peyser 
complaint that is not 
resolved at the local 
level? 
 
No.  If a complaint is made against ESD and such complaint has not been resolved 
within 15 working days, the complaint contact shall elevate the complaint to the state 
following procedures noted in section 1.6.1 of the handbook. 
11.  For Wagner-Peyser, 
what is the difference 
between a complaint 
and an apparent 
violation? 
 
An apparent violation is a violation of employment law made by an employer, where 
an ESD representative observes, has reason to believe, or is in receipt of 
information regarding a suspected violation.  Apparent violations do not involve a 
written and signed allegation made by a customer against an employer.   
 
Partners should be cautioned that it is not within ESD’s role to search out potential 
employer violations of employment law.  However, if violations of employment law 
become apparent, such situations must be documented and reported to the 
appropriate complaint contact for processing according to the requirements 
in section 1.9 of this handbook.  Complaint contacts shall evaluate the individual 
circumstances of the issue presented and determine whether the allegation warrants 
action. 
 
12.  In section 1.6.2, there 
is no mention of 
attempting to resolve 
complaints.  Does that 
mean that all 
complaints alleging 
an employment law 
violation against an 
employer need to be 
referred directly to the 
appropriate agency? 
 
Yes.  Previous Wagner-Peyser and MSFW complaint policies and procedures 
required that complaint specialists (now known as complaint contacts) attempt to 
resolve complaints alleging a violation of employment law or a violation of H2 
regulations prior to making a referral to the appropriate enforcement agency.  While 
well intentioned, involvement in such complaints that do not require intervention may 
put ESD at risk as unnecessary involvement may delay appropriate action from 
authorized agencies.   
 
Partners, may however, attempt to resolve customer concerns involving H-2 program 
violations or employment law violations in alignment with their local policy and 
procedures.      
13.  It seems impractical 
to require follow-up 
on ES complaints 
alleging employment 
law violations once 
they have been 
referred to another 
Per 20 CFR 658.416(b)(1), the referring agency “shall follow-up with the 
enforcement agency monthly regarding MSFW complaints and quarterly regarding 
non-MSFW complaints, and shall inform the complainant of the status of the 
complaint periodically.”  The intent of this section to ensure ESD is informed whether 
an employer who filed a job order within the last twelve months violated employment 
law.  If the employer is found to have violated employment law, ESD shall initiate 
discontinuation of services procedures consistent with 20 CFR 658 Subpart F.   
Page 35 of 37 
 
agency.  Shouldn’t the 
agency handling the 
referral be 
responsible for 
follow-up? 
 
 
14.  What happens if a 
complainant moves 
and we don’t receive a 
confirmation receipt?   
 
When using certified mail, a confirmation receipt is normally returned.  If the 
confirmation receipt is returned that indicates the complainant no longer resides at 
the address provided, or the certified mail is returned as undeliverable and no other 
form of contact is available, the receipt or returned mail will be saved in a file as a 
document that confirms an attempt to make contact was made. 
 
15.  Can only ESD 
discontinue services 
or can a Non-ESD 
entity providing labor 
exchange services 
also discontinue 
services?   
 
Per 20 CFR 658.501(a), “the State agency shall initiate procedures for 
discontinuation of services to employers.”  This language places the burden on ESD 
to initiate discontinuation of services procedures.  Depending on the circumstances, 
non-ESD entities providing labor exchange services may, however, recommend that 
ESD initiate discontinuation of services. 
 
16.  What specific 
services could be 
discontinued 
according to the 
Wagner-Peyser 
complaint process? 
 
Labor exchange services would no longer be provided to the employer in question.  
Other services may be discontinued if such services are supported by Wagner
Peyser funds.   
 
17.  Where can I find a 
WorkSource 
complaint poster that 
satisfies Wagner
Peyser requirements? 
 
You may print a copy of the WorkSource Complaint Poster for your office.  The 
poster must be printed in color on 11’ X 17’ card stock paper in order to enhance 
readability. 
 
If you would prefer to request a copy of Washington’s ETA-approved WorkSource 
complaint poster (above), or if you have questions or comments regarding the Initial 
Customer Complaint Policy, please contact WCDDpolicy@esd.wa.gov.   
 
18.  Why are TAA 
Complaint & Eligibility 
Appeal Procedures 
included in the 
handbook? 
TAA complaint & eligibility appeals procedures were added to the handbook in order 
to increase visibility of TAA requirements among partners.  In addition, it made 
sense to centralize the location of TAA complaint procedures and appeal procedures 
to make partners aware that there are specific procedures for each.   
 
19.  Why is the term 
“grievance” not 
defined or noted in 
the WIA complaint 
procedures?  
 
The term “grievance,” while noted in WIA regulations is not defined.  In addition, a 
review of WIA complaint procedures from other states indicated that the word 
“grievance” is often used interchangeably with the word “complaint.”  To reduce 
possible confusion, WCDD decided to eliminate the use of the word “grievance” until 
guidance is received from DOL offering a definition that is different from the word 
complaint. 
 
20.  For WIA complaints, 
can a complaint 
contact serve as an 
impartial hearing 
officer? 
 
A complaint contact may serve as an impartial hearing officer only if s/he is not 
directly connected to the allegations or potentially affected by the results of the

impartial decision in order to avoid the appearance of unfairness.  Local procedures 
could establish the WDC, or representative of the WDC, as a hearing officer (if s/he 
is not directly connected or potentially affected by the determination).

The Washington State Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) serves as an 
independent state agency that conducts impartial administrative hearings.  OAH’s 
website at <http://www.oah.wa.gov/hearings.shtml> offers instruction on how to
